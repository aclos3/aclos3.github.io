				<p>Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Andrew Clos and I live in Newport, OR. I graduated from 
				the University of Washington in 2008 with a BS in Chemical Oceanography.  This led to a my first career with the National Oceanic and
				Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) where I worked as a contractor and then served as a NOAA Corps Officer until early 2019.
				In addition to deck watch officer duties (navigating ships, managing personnel), I specialized in the making nautical charts.
				Utilizing multibeam echosounders and sophisticated positioning systems, we could create high resolution bathymetric plots of the
				sea floor.  </p>
				<p>I am looking forward to this career change and would love to learn about A.I. and apply that to autonomous vessels that collect data at sea.  However, as I move through the program I will keep a very open mind and may find a completely different passion within the field.
				In my free time I like to work on classic cars, ski, go camping, play frisbee. </p>
