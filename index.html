				<p>Hi everyone, my name is Andrew and I live in Newport, OR.  I graduated from the UW in 2008 with a degree in Oceanography.  I have been working for NOAA as an officer where I drive ships and make nautical charts.  I am looking forward to this career change and would love to learn about A.I. and apply that to autonomous vessels that collect data at sea.  However, as I move through the program I will keep a very open mind and may find a completely different passion within the field.  

In my free time I like to work on classic cars, ski, go camping, play frisbee. </p>
