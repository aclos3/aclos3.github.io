        <h3>Step 3 Final to Step 4 Draft</h3>
        <p>These changes were made based on feedback from grading and team collaboration to refine the HTML template and best prepare
            our database outline for implementation.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>firstName and lastName attributes were added to the Employee table</li>
            <li>A constraint that the combined firstName and lastName of an Employee or Customer must be unique.
                <ul><li>Although it is possible in the real world to have two people with the same first and last name, we felt this design
                    decision would make the database more interesting by providing a UNIQUE key.
                </li></ul>
            <li>The customerId and employeeId foreign key attributes of the Sales table were shortened to eID and cID.</li>
            <li>The saleId and productId foreign key attributes of the Sales_Products table were shortened to sID and pID.</li>
            <li>Added "See All" option to each table page.  This will show every entity within that table.</li>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Step 3 Draft to Final Changes</h3>
        <p>These changes were made for the Final Edition (Step 3) based on peer and TA feedback:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create dynamic drop down menu (Piazza @170).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When ADDing a new Sale, have the option to select a customer from a drop down list.  This list will be populated by using 
            a SELECT to query all customers and populate the drop down.</li>
          </ul><br>
          <li>Show FK attributes of Sales_Products any time a Sale or Product is queried and make sure the INSERT (add) page for these two tables
            updates the Sales_Products intersection table as well.</li>
          <li>Added productId as a search element for products.</li>
          <li>Example search for a product changed to just return a single product.  As if the user had searched for "Clown Fish" or productId "2"</li>
          <li>Example search for a sale changed to return two sales generated by employee 14 (as if the user had searched for Employee 14's sales on a certain date.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Corresponding Sales_Products table shows saleId 1 containing 3 different products and sale id 23 containing 1 product.</li>
          </ul><br>
        </ul>
